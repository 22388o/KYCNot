  long-description: Hodl Hodl is a global P2P Bitcoin trading platform, that allows
    users to trade directly with each other and it doesn't hold user’s funds — locking
    it in multisig escrow instead. This minimizes the possibility of Bitcoin assets
    theft and reduces trading time. Because Hodl Hodl does not hold any money (neither
    Bitcoin, nor fiat) it is not subject to complex compliance procedures. This allows
    trades to happen directly between users' wallets and without having to submit
    your identity to the trading platform.

  - <p class="collapse-panel--text">ChangeNOW strives to protect our clients from
    any type of scams and fraudulent activities in the crypto world and complies to
    all rules and regulations present at the moment, and one of the ways that enables
    us to do so is the KYC/AML procedure.</p>
  - <p class="collapse-panel--text">This procedure confirms the absolute legality
    of the transaction carried out by you before the regulatory institutions. Thus,
    you confirm that you are a law-abiding citizen and the state has no reason to
    address any claims towards you.</p>
  - <p class="collapse-panel--text">ChangeNOW’s AML/KYC procedure is supported by
    an automated risk prevention system. If a transaction is marked suspicious by
    this system, the exchange is put on hold and the customer in question is then
    asked to confirm their identity.</p>
  - <p class="collapse-panel--text">There is a certain set of criteria that the system
    employs; however, they can’t be made public, otherwise there will be people who
    will try to abuse those criteria in order to cheat the algorithm.</p>
  - <p class="collapse-panel--text">This system has proven to be very useful against
    money launderers and scammers, since the KYC process allows us to tell an honest
    customer apart from a scammer very quickly and without any trouble.</p>
  - <p class="collapse-panel--text">Each KYC case is handled individually. If a certain
    client is eligible for the procedure since their transaction had been marked as
    suspicious, they will have a special status update on the exchange page along
    with a Verify button; the button will lead to our KYC provider SumSub’s verification
    tool.</p>
  - <p class="collapse-panel--text">ChangeNOW is partnered with a KYC provider called
    SumSub. In order to get your identity verified, you will be offered to follow
    SumSub’s link (it will be under the Verify button) and complete the verification
    through a comfortable and smooth UI. You will have 3 days to complete the verification
    procedure, and if you don’t want to pass KYC, you can refuse (in that case, please
    shoot a message to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9deee8ededf2efe9ddfef5fcf3faf8f3f2eab3f4f2"><span
    class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b0c3c5c0c0dfc2c4f0d3d8d1ded7d5dedfc79ed9df">[email protected]</span></a>)
    and receive a refund.</p>
  - <p class="collapse-panel--text">After ChangeNOW has received the confirmation
    of you having passed the KYC procedure from SumSub, the exchange is completed,
    and the exchanged funds are then sent to the specified recipient wallet address.</p>
  - <p class="collapse-panel--text">We do everything in our power to maintain our
    reputation as a legitimate, law-abiding exchange service that can be safe for
    use by anyone, be it a regular person who doesn’t deal with crypto much or an
    experienced trader or miner; therefore, ChangeNOW reserves the right to apply
    the KYC/AML procedure to certain clients, wallet addresses and select assets.</p>
  - <p class="collapse-panel--text">ChangeNOW doesn’t support any money-laundering
    or other illegal activities; therefore, the service doesn’t enter any business
    agreements with individuals or business entities involved or suspected in such
    activities. Therefore, if a customer’s funds are suspected of illegal activities,
    the KYC procedure will be a little different – in that case, our support team
    will let you know.</p>
  - <p class="collapse-panel--text">In case a client doesn’t wish to disclose their
    identity for certain reasons and refuses to provide the documents, the KYC/AML
    procedure is considered failed and the deposited funds are then refunded to the
    address (or addresses) the deposit was made from, subtracting the network fees,
    within 24 hours. Then, ChangeNOW reserves the right to blacklist this address
    (or addresses), thus rendering it (or them) non-eligible for making deposits on
    the service.</p>
  - <p class="collapse-panel--text">In case a client submits a false set of documents,

    (or addresses), thus rendering it (or them) non-eligible for making deposits on

    ticket.</p>
  - <p class="collapse-panel--text">Kindly note that we will be able to return frozen

    one of your transactions is marked as suspicious and then they will require you
    a KYC procedure. The suspicious transaction detection system is not public so
    we can't know what may trigger this. You can get a refund to your address if you
