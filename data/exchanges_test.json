Cancellations.</span><br/><br/><span style=\"color:#000000\">Cancellation of orders. You may only cancel an order initiated via the Services if such cancellation occurs before KuCoin executes the transaction. Once your order has been executed, you may not change, withdraw or cancel your authorization for KuCoin to complete such transaction. If an order has been partially filled, you may cancel the unfilled remainder. We may cancel your order in the following circumstances: (i) you have, in our view, engaged in market manipulation or abuse (as described in Section 12.1 below); (ii) your order under the circumstances involves an obvious error with respect to price, quantity or other parameters; (iii) your order would result in self-execution as described in Section 7.1 below;(iv) if required by any applicable law or regulation; and/or (v) if required for technical reasons, such as system maintenance and/or upgrade.</span><br/><span style=\"color:#000000\">Cancellation of trades.

Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the trades you complete via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority.

KuCoin Account Funds</span><br/><br/><span style=\"color:#000000\">6.1. Transferring Funds to your KuCoin Account. In order to place or match an order or trade via the Services (as described in Section 7), you must first transfer Funds to your KuCoin Account using one of the approved External Accounts identified via the Services. You may be required to verify that you control the External Account that you use to load Funds to your KuCoin Account. You may be charged fees by the External Account you use to transfer Funds to your KuCoin Account. KuCoin is not responsible for any External Account fees or for the management and security of any External Account. You are solely responsible for your use of any External Account, and you agree to comply with all terms and conditions applicable to any External Account. The timing associated with a transaction for the transfer of Funds to or from an External Account will depend in part upon the performance of third parties responsible for maintaining the applicable External Account, and KuCoin makes no guarantee regarding the amount of time it may take to transfer Funds into your KuCoin Account.</span><br/><br/><span style=\"color:#000000\">6.2. Transferring Funds to an External Account.

Transfer Authorization. When you request that we transfer Funds into your KuCoin Account from your External Account or request that we transfer Funds to your External Account from your KuCoin Account, you authorize KuCoin to execute such transaction via the Services.</span><br/><br/><span style=\"color:#000000\">6.4.

You agree that you will not hold KuCoin liable for any loss resulting from such rejected transactions.</span><br/><br/><span style=\"color:#000000\">6.5. Ownership of Digital Tokens. You hereby represent and warrant that any Digital Tokens transferred to your KuCoin Account from an External Account or otherwise used by you in connection with the Services are owned by you legally and beneficially, and that all orders, trades and transactions initiated with your KuCoin Account are for your own account and not on behalf of any other person or entity.</span><br/><br/><span style=\"color:#000000\">7. Exchange Orders and Trades</span><br/><br/><span style=\"color:#000000\">This Section applies when you use the Services to trade one type of Digital Tokens for another type of Digital Tokens. A trade is a binding agreement between you and another user to exchange an agreed amount of one form of Digital Tokens, for an agreed amount of another form of Digital Tokens, which exchange is supported by the Services and which is in accordance with these Terms. KuCoin does not purchase, sell, or exchange any Digital Tokens on its own behalf, does not provide services for the trading of Digital Tokens for Fiat Currency and vice versa, and does not provide services for the trading of one Fiat Currency for another Fiat Currency.</span><br/><br/><span style=\"color:#000000\">7.1. Order Placement, Authorization. An order is created when you enter an instruction to buy or sell a specified quantity of a type of Digital Token at a specified price. To place an order, you must have a sufficient amount of the relevant Funds in your KuCoin Account to cover the total value of the order plus any applicable fees (as described in Section 9 below).</span><br/><span style=\"color:#000000\">You are not able to place an order which would result in self-execution, that is, where you would act as both the buyer and seller in respect of the same trade. If two orders of the same quantity would result in self-execution, both orders are cancelled. </span><br/><span style=\"color:#000000\">When you submit a new order via the Services, and it is matched with another order and it results in a trade under the Services, you will be deemed to have authorized KuCoin to execute and settle the trade in accordance with such order on a spot basis and charge you any applicable fees (as described in Section 9 below).</span><br/><br/><span style=\"color:#000000\">7.2.

Market volatility. Particularly during periods of high volume, illiquidity, fast movement or volatility in the marketplace for any particular, or one or more Digital Tokens, the actual market rate at which a trade is executed may be different from the prevailing rate indicated via the Services at the time of your order or trade. You understand that we are not liable for any such price fluctuations. In the event of a market disruption or Force Majeure event (as defined in Section 22), KuCoin may do one or more of the following: (a) suspend access to the Services; or (b) prevent you from completing any actions via the Services, including closing any open positions. Following any such event, when trading resumes, you acknowledge that prevailing market rates may differ significantly from the rates available prior to such event.</span><br/><br/><span style=\"color:#000000\">7.6.

Error Correction Attempts. A Manifest Error is an error or omission, which by fault of you or us or any user or third party or due to any disruptions, errors, distortions or delays, is materially and clearly incorrect when taking into account market conditions, rates and prices which prevailed at that time. It may include, but is not limited to, an incorrect price, date, time, Digital Token pair, fee, or any error or lack of clarity of any information or source.</span><br/><br/><span style=\"color:#000000\">If an order, trade or transfer is based on a Manifest Error (regardless of whether you or we or any other user gains from the error) and/or executed and/or settled on the basis of Manifest Error, KuCoin may (but is not obliged to), at its option and sole discretion, act reasonably and in good faith to: (a) correct, reverse or cancel any order, trade or transfer; (b) void a trade as if it had never taken place; and/or (b) amend a trade so that its terms are the same as the trade which would have been executed if there had been no Manifest Error.</span><br/><br/><span style=\"color:#000000\">We will exercise the foregoing rights as soon as reasonably practicable after we become aware of the Manifest Error. To the extent practicable we will give you prior notice of any action we take under this clause but if this is not practicable we will give you notice as soon as practicable afterwards. If you consider that an order, trade or transfer is based on a Manifest Error, then you must notify us immediately. We will consider in good faith whether it is appropriate to take any action under this Section 7.7 taking into account all the information relating to the situation, including market conditions and your level of expertise.</span><br/><br/><span style=\"color:#000000\">You hereby authorize KuCoin to attempt and/or perform any such correction, reversal, cancellation, voiding or amendment described in this section.

Please note that if you use a spam filter that blocks or re-routes emails from senders not listed in your email address book, you must add KuCoin to your email address book so that you will be able to receive the Communications we send to you. You can update your email address at any time by logging into your KuCoin Account or by contacting KuCoin Help Center.
