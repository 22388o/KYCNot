### Listing request

The first KYCNOTME version was quite a chaos and a lot of disorder when proposing new services. It reached a point where I couldn't handle all the listing requests so I stepped away for a while. Listing requests will be a bit different now.

If you want to propose or ask for a service to be listed you **must** follow these steps:

1. Fill the following e-mail body (your text must **replace the curly braces**):
```
{SERVICE NAME} listing request.

Category: {SERVICE / EXCHANGE}

Why should it be listed: 
{TEXT}

Evidence of NO-KYC practices (images, text, links, etc.):
{EVIDENCE OF ANY KIND}

Have you used the service? If possible provide evidence.
{YES / NO} {EVIDENCE}

How was your experience?
{EXPLANATION}

---
{GENERATED YAML}
```
2. **Generate** a YAML code for your listing. If it's an Exchange use [this link](https://kycnot.me/generate-new-exchange). If it is a Service use [this link](https://kycnot.me/generate-new-service). And **replace** the `{GENERATED YAML}` with it.
3. **Send an e-mail with the request** to the following direction:
- `request [at] kycnot [dot] me`

> **IMPORTANT**: All emails that do not follow these guidelines will be filtered and ignored.

### Delisting request

1. Fill the following e-mail body:

```
{SERVICE NAME} delisting request.

Why should it be listed:
{TEXT}

Evidence:
{EVIDENCE OF ANY KIND}
```

2. **Send an e-mail with the request** to the following direction:
- `request [at] kycnot [dot] me`
