    <h2 id="why">Why this?</h2>
    <p>
      Cryptocurrencies are meant to make a change on the way we pay and exchange
      goods. They are made to untie the dependency between the users (customers)
      and the centralized entities that are in control (law enforced) of our
      economy (e.g. Banks, FED, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      KYC and AML exchanges are the most common nowadays, they act exactly like
      a bank when using their wallets (most newbies or “traders” do so). You
      (usually) don't own any private key, so the funds aren't fully yours, they
      own your keys (if there are any keys that belong to you). They also
      require you to identify yourself in order to operate there (e.g. photo of
      your ID). All of this together goes against the most valuable benefits of
      cryptocurrencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      With KYCNOT.ME I want to make it easier for people to find trustworthy
      ways to buy, exchange, trade and use cryptos without needing to identify
      themselves, and preserving the decentralized and self-governed essence of
      Cryptocurrencies.
    </p>

    <h2 id="btcxmr">Why only Bitcoin and Monero?</h2>
    <p>
      Bitcoin because is the biggest, with the most market cap, most adoption
      and most used among all cryptos. Monero because it is the true digital
      money, the only one that preserves privacy by design and brings true
      fungibility.
    </p>
    <p>I am considering adding Nano too.</p>

    <h2 id="funded">How is KYCNOT.ME funded?</h2>
    <p>
      I pay for everything myself and I dedicated a lot of my free-time on this
      project. If you find this useful you can contribute by
      <a href="#support">donating</a> or helping the project :)
    </p>

    <h2 id="listings">Why is "X" not listed?</h2>
    <p>
      There may be many answers to this question. For now, I'm alone with this
      project and my time is limited and before adding a
      Exchange/Merchant/Service I need to make some investigation in order to be
      sure that it compiles with the KYCNOT.ME requirements. So one of the
      reasons, if it was suggested is that maybe I haven't had the time to
      investigate on it. If you're patient I promise I will be investigating all
      the suggestions I recieve.
    </p>

    <h2 id="features">Will <i>X feature</i> be implemented?</h2>
    <p>
      Again, I'm alone with this. I would love to be implementing a lot of thing
      I have in mind but time is limited and I am not fulltime on this, in fact
      I have a job and several personal projects at the moment. The time I am
      dedicating to kycnot.me is limited and I would really like to be able to
      dedicate it much more time.
    </p>
    <p>As I will always say, contributors are very welcome.</p>

    <h2 id="js">Javascript and the project</h2>
    <p>
      I don't want to use Javascript at all. If I ever use it, the website will
      always be available for anti-javascript users. Any suggestions must take
      this into account in order to be added to the project.
    </p>

    <h2 id="opensource">Why Open Source?</h2>
    <p>
      Well, it's not a very big service / project (maybe in the future will
      grow) but I really believe in Open Source. I want people to be able to
      contribute with it, request features, to make suggestions and I want as
      well to interact with them. I am not a company, I'm a individual who wants
      to make the usage of cryptos fairer and try to preserve its good
      characteristics.
    </p>

    <h2 id="trackers">Website has trackers?</h2>
    <p>
      No, and never will. I don't want to know anything from anyone who visits
      this site. You can even visit this site without Javascript activated and
      it will fully work.
    </p>

    <h2 id="fyi">FYI: I'm not a web developer!</h2>
    <p>
      Although I know how to create a website and all, I am not a web developer.
      The website may not be sufficiently efficient or it may have some errors
      on the way things are done. If you notice something you can fix it and
      create a PR and I will merge it!

    <h1 id="criteria"><u>The listing criteria and service evaluations</u></h1>
    <p>
      There's not (yet) a well established criteria on the decision-making
      process. But the following are points which I think I really value (not
      the only ones, nor the decisive ones) when choosing a service to be
      listed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>No KYC (of course)</li>
      <li>No tracking of suspicious transactions</li>
      <li>No registration needed</li>
      <li>Ammout of personal data if required to register</li>
      <li>Tor mirrors</li>
      <li>Good reviews, active on social networks, support team...</li>
      <li>Clear and readable Terms of Service</li>
      <li>Decentralization</li>
      <li>Open Source-ness</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="listing">Requesting a new listing/delisting</h2>
    <p>
      For more information on how to request listings and delistings refer to
      <a
        href="https://codeberg.org/pluja/kycnot.me/src/branch/main/README.md#listing-request"
        target="_blank"
        >the official repository</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h2 id="kyclevel">What is the KYC Level?</h2>
    <p>
      It is a way to rank the KYC types and probability for a particular exchange. The levels go from 0 (No KYC at all) to 3.

      <ul>
        <li><b>Level 0</b>: No KYC. The exchange ToS do not mention that it will ever request the user for a KYC verification.</li>
        <li><b>Level 1</b>: KYC is rare. The platform does not mention KYC/AML procedures as such, but the service has the right to share acquired data with representatives of the authorities and block funds or reject transactions.</li>
        <li><b>Level 2</b>: The exchange may request KYC. Although KYC is not mandatory, the exchange reserves the right to require KYC for a certain user at a certain moment and may block funds. May be that a transaction is detected as suspicious or any other reason.</li>
        <li><b>Level 3</b>: KYC is mandatory in order to use some features. Also, a non-KYCed user can be asked to verify their identity at any time or any moment for any reason.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2 id="check">What is the KYCNOT.ME check?</h2>
    <p>
      It is an automated review of the ToS of each service. It searches for
      potential-KYC-enforcement words on the ToS page and if there is sufficient
      evidence the service will not pass the check. This is to notify users if a
      ToS have changed and the service is still listed, or if the service is
      listed but it has KYC-enforcement for some cases.
    </p>

    <h2 id="score">What is the KYCNOT.ME score?</h2>
    <p>
      It is an automatic score that is given to every listed service. It is
      based on the ponderation of the above mentioned criteria.

    <h1><u>You are the only one responsible for your actions</u></h1>

    <p>
      This page provides a list of services that allow users to interact without
      KYC. KYCNOT.ME is not responsible for a service turning out fraudulent, a
      service disappearing without any notice or any loss of funds. You must
      know that bad things can happen and there is bad people out there, so
      please make your own investigation and check twice before anything.
